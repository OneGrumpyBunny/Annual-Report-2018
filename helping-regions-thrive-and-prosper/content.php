				<h1>Helping Regions Thrive and Prosper</h1>
				<p class="light">Children will not thrive if they cannot read. Youth will not flourish without education or skills training. Countries will not prosper without electricity or infrastructure. From improving literacy rates for seven million Kenyan children, to providing electricity access to 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, to offer training for the 20% of unemployed youth in Rwanda, we are living our mission every day to help communities around the world achieve a brighter future.</p>
