				<h1>Helping Regions Thrive and Prosper</h1>
				<p class="light">Children will not thrive if they cannot read. Youth will not flourish without education or skills training. Countries will not prosper without electricity or infrastructure. From improving literacy rates for 7 million Kenyan children, to providing electricity access to 600 million people in sub-Saharan Africa, to offer training for the 20% of unemployed youth in Rwanda, we are living our mission every day to help communities around the world achieve a brighter future.</p>
