Instead, she’s resorted to selling second-hand clothes in the streets of Kigali, working all day to earn approximately 2,000 Rwandan francs (US$2.30).</p>

				<p>A large percentage of disadvantaged youths in Indonesia either do not complete their secondary education or are unable to continue at a postsecondary level. Having no real marketable skills, they opt instead for one of two vocational training options: a BLK, or state-owned vocational training school—the rough equivalent of an American community college or technical high school—or an LPK or informal vocational training center, which is independently operated and less regulated by the government.</p>

				<p>Child development begins before a child is born, and much depends on the health and well-being of the mother. For example, maternal diet; maternal alcohol or nicotine use; and maternal stress, depression, and anxiety during pregnancy affect the developing fetus—leading to prematurity; low birth weight; and increased risk for health, developmental, and behavioral challenges throughout life.</p>

In 2013, the U.S. Agency for International Development chose RTI to lead a strategic enterprise and workforce development program for Haiti. This effort, known as Haiti Local Enterprise and Value Chain Enhancement, or Haiti LEVE, is designed to stimulate job creation by building up enterprises in agribusiness, apparel and textiles, and construction.</p>
