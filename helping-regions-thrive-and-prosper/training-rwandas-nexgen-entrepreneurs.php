            <p class="light">Twenty-six-year-old Egidie Twizeyeyezu graduated from the University of Rwanda in 2015 with a degree in economics and entrepreneurship. Since then, she has been unable to find a job. Instead, she’s resorted to selling second-hand clothes in the streets of Kigali, working all day to earn approximately 2,000 Rwandan francs (US$2.30). While some work was better than no work, street vending was not a long-term employment solution for Twizeyeyezu. “The business of selling any commodity on the streets was very risky, as the government restricts it,” she says. </p>
