            <h1>Achieving educational improvements at a national level: Lessons from Kenya</h1>
            <h2>Test test test</h2>
            <p class="light">If you can dramatically improve educational outcomes in a school, can you do it across the district? How about across an entire country? How about across more than the 22,000 schools in Kenya that serve more than 3.3 million Grade 1-3 students?</p>
            <p class="light">In recent years some educational interventions have dramatically improved learning outcomes on a small scale, and several countries are now attempting to replicate those successes at a national level. However, history is littered with the remains of pilot programs that failed when attempts were made to implement at scale.</p>
