				<p>Of Nigeria’s population of nearly 300 million people, 71 million do not have access to clean water and 130 million do not have access to basic sanitation. This lack of water, sanitation, and hygiene services—exacerbated by accelerated urbanization, poor cost recovery, and weak governance and institutional frameworks—adversely affects Nigerian citizens’ health, as well as their access to educational and economic opportunities and their work efficiency and labor productivity.</p>

				<p>The class of chemicals known as PFAS—per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances—poses a unique threat to public health that our chemical and environmental engineers are working to solve. These include PFOA, PFOS, and more than 3,000 related chemicals, including the GenX variant known for polluting the Cape Fear River in southeastern North Carolina. The Department of Defense’s Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program is looking for a solution and began working with RTI in mid-2018 to investigate a method of breaking down PFAS.</p>
