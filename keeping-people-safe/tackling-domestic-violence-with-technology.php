            <h1>How Blockchain Can Help Victims of Domestic Violence in California</h1>
            <h2>Using an innovative technology to digitize the submission of mandatory reporting forms </h2>
            <p class="light">According to California law, reports of domestic or other interpersonal violence must be forwarded by health care providers to law-enforcement authorities within 72 hours. The trouble is that there is no consistency in how these reports are filed: some are handwritten, some are transmitted by fax (never mind if the machine on the other end is actually working), and some are simply lost en route. In 2014, one study showed that less than one-third of domestic violence reports filed by California doctors and hospitals made it to the police within the mandated three-day reporting period, hampering crime investigations, identification of at-risk victims, and collections of available funds for victims of crime.</p>
			<p class="light">In 2018, RTI launched a pilot study with Collaborative Health Solutions (CHS) to implement a blockchain-based solution to this problem. Blockchain is a data-storage system, distributed across a network of computers, that almost guarantees the privacy and integrity of information without being controlled by any one entity. That is to say, the records are highly resistant to being altered, lost, or accidentally deleted, which is why this system is the backbone of virtual currencies like Bitcoin</p>
