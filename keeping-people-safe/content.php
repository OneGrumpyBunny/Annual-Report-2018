				<p>In a nationally representative survey of state and local law enforcement agencies conducted by RTI for the National Institute of Justice, 18% of unsolved sexual assault cases from 2003 through 2007 had forensic evidence that was not submitted to a crime laboratory for analysis. Unsubmitted sexual assault kits create delays in the justice system and, in some instances, deny justice to sexual assault survivors.</p>

				<p>What provokes people to join racist, violent, far-right hate groups? In 2015, we were contracted by the Department of Justice to perform research on this subject. In collaboration with our partners, Dr. Kathleen Blee of the University of Pittsburgh and Dr. Peter Simi of Chapman University, we contacted dozens of former white supremacists nationwide. We sat down with these people and conducted in-depth life-history interviews, asking them questions about their families, their childhoods, their education and employment, and how they were recruited into, and mustered the courage to leave, various violent, far-right extremist groups.</p>

				<p>According to California law, reports of domestic or other interpersonal violence must be forwarded by health care providers to law enforcement authorities within 72 hours. The trouble is that there is no consistency in how these reports are filed: some are handwritten, some are transmitted by fax (never mind if the machine on the other end is actually working), and some are simply lost en route.</p>

				<p>Although medicinal marijuana is legal in several states and the District of Columbia, it remains illegal under federal law. Therefore, it and related products such as CBD do not receive quality assurance oversight from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. As a result, the oils, tinctures, and vaporization liquids offered online have varying levels of CBD, and listings of ingredients on the labels are unreliable.</p>

				<p>Police work can have negative effects on officers’ physical health, mental health, and work/life issues—such as work/family conflict and problems in relationships. For law enforcement agencies, officer stress manifests as increased absenteeism; turnover; and declines in performance—including slower reaction time; poorer decision-making ability; and an increased number of complaints, policy violations, and misconduct allegations.</p>

				<p>Improving communication between prescribers and pharmacists could be an important step in reducing opioid misuse and diversion and improving public health. While much of the education and training available on reducing opioid misuse and diversion stresses the importance of interprofessional communication between prescribers and pharmacists, few studies have explored those communication patterns directly. To better understand this issue, a team of researchers conducted in-depth individual interviews with 48 primary care providers (PCPs) and 60 community pharmacists about the nature, frequency, and content of communication between PCPs and pharmacists focusing on opioids.</p>
