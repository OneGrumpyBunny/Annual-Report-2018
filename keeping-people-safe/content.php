			<div id="section1" data-section="section1" class="acc-body">
				<p>In a nationally representative survey of state and local law enforcement agencies conducted by RTI for the National Institute of Justice, 18% of unsolved sexual assault cases from 2003 through 2007 had forensic evidence that was not submitted to a crime laboratory for analysis. Unsubmitted sexual assault kits create delays in the justice system and, in some instances, deny justice to sexual assault survivors.</p>

				<p>Since the election of President Barack Obama, white supremacy groups have been increasingly active and visible in the United States. The most notorious example of this trend may be the “Unite the Right” rally in Charlottesville in August 2017, in which neo-Nazis, neo-Confederates, and members of various militia groups marched with provocative signs and banners and chanted racist and anti-Semitic slogans. The Charlottesville rally (and the concurrent reaction by anti-fascist activists, or “Antifa”) brought white supremacy back into the national conversation and served as an unfortunate advertisement for a vile cause.</p>

				<p>According to California law, reports of domestic or other interpersonal violence must be forwarded by health care providers to law enforcement authorities within 72 hours. The trouble is that there is no consistency in how these reports are filed: some are handwritten, some are transmitted by fax (never mind if the machine on the other end is actually working), and some are simply lost en route.</p>

				<p>Although medicinal marijuana is legal in several states and the District of Columbia, it remains illegal under federal law. Therefore, it and related products such as CBD do not receive quality assurance oversight from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. As a result, the oils, tinctures, and vaporization liquids offered online have varying levels of CBD, and listings of ingredients on the labels are unreliable.</p>

				<p>Police work can have negative effects on officers’ physical health, mental health, and work/life issues—such as work/family conflict and problems in relationships. For law enforcement agencies, officer stress manifests as increased absenteeism; turnover; and declines in performance—including slower reaction time; poorer decision-making ability; and an increased number of complaints, policy violations, and misconduct allegations.</p>
