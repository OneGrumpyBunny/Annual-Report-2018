				<p>To help empower women in low- and middle-income countries and improve their health, the U.S. Agency for International Development, through the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), awarded RTI a $4.8-million cooperative agreement to develop a dual-purpose drug delivery device for both HIV and pregnancy prevention that can be successfully used in these settings.</p>

				<p>One-sixth of the worldwide population—more than 1 billion people—suffers from one or more neglected tropical diseases. These diseases devastate the world’s most vulnerable populations, striking the almost exclusively poor and powerless people in rural areas and urban slums in low-income countries.</p>

				<p>In the wake of a severe heart attack, also known as an ST-elevation myocardial infarction, receiving effective treatment within several hours is crucial to reduce muscular damage and the risk of death. Effective treatment requires reperfusion (opening the blocked artery) using either thrombolytic medications or a more expensive (and more effective) percutaneous coronary intervention performed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory.</p>

				<p>There are more than 14,000 specialty addiction treatment programs in the United States. Although addiction can be treated with the same effectiveness as other chronic diseases, there is significant variability in the nature and quality of treatment services offered by these addiction providers. Consumer report cards are a well-established approach to improving the accountability and quality of health care providers.</p>
