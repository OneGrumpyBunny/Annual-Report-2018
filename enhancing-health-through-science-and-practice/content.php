				<p>In sub-Saharan Africa, women have among the highest fertility rates in the world. Unfortunately, they are also disproportionately at risk for HIV, a leading cause of illness and death among women of reproductive age.  To help empower women in low- and middle-income countries and improve their health, the U.S. Agency for International Development, through the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), awarded RTI a $4.8-million cooperative agreement to develop a dual-purpose drug delivery device for both HIV and pregnancy prevention that can be successfully used in these settings.</p>

				<p>In the wake of a severe heart attack, also known as an ST-elevation myocardial infarction, receiving effective treatment within several hours is crucial to reduce muscular damage and the risk of death. Effective treatment requires reperfusion (opening the blocked artery) using either thrombolytic medications or a more expensive&mdash;and more effective&mdash;percutaneous coronary intervention performed in a cardiac catheterization laboratory. Given the need for rapid treatment, a few factors can mean the difference between life, death, and long-term disability. </p>
